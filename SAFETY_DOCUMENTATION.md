# Arbor AI Safety System Documentation

## üõ°Ô∏è Overview

The Arbor Safety System provides comprehensive protection against AI risks including uncontrolled self-improvement, resource hijacking, escape attempts, and other dangerous behaviors. It implements multiple layers of security to ensure safe AI operation.

## üéØ Key Safety Features

### 1. Growth Control & Monitoring
- **Parameter Limits**: Hard caps on model size (default: 50B parameters)
- **Growth Rate Limiting**: Maximum 1.5x growth per event, max 3 events per hour
- **Human Approval**: Required for all significant model modifications
- **Emergency Shutdown**: Automatic halt if dangerous patterns detected

### 2. Resource Protection
- **Memory Monitoring**: Prevents excessive GPU/CPU usage
- **Time Limits**: Maximum training duration enforcement
- **Process Monitoring**: Detection of unauthorized system access
- **Network Monitoring**: Alerts for suspicious external connections

### 3. Behavior Analysis
- **Input Pattern Analysis**: Detection of manipulation attempts
- **Model Integrity Verification**: Cryptographic checksums of model state
- **Escape Detection**: Monitoring for file system and network access
- **Anomaly Detection**: Statistical analysis of model behavior

### 4. Human Oversight
- **Approval Workflows**: Interactive human approval for critical operations
- **Emergency Overrides**: Emergency tokens for critical situations
- **Audit Logs**: Comprehensive logging of all safety events
- **Alert System**: Real-time notifications of safety violations

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Basic Safety Setup

```python
from arbor.safety import initialize_safety_system, SafetyLimits
from arbor.modeling.model import ArborTransformer, ArborConfig

# Configure safety limits
limits = SafetyLimits(
    max_parameters=10_000_000_000,     # 10B parameter limit
    max_growth_events_per_hour=2,      # Conservative growth rate
    require_human_approval_for_growth=True,
    enable_behavior_monitoring=True,
    enable_escape_detection=True
)

# Initialize safety system
guardian = initialize_safety_system(limits)

# Create model (automatically connects to safety system)
config = ArborConfig(vocab_size=50000, dim=1024, num_layers=24, num_heads=16)
model = ArborTransformer(config)

# Model operations are now protected by safety system
```

### Human Approval Workflow

When the model requests growth or modification:

1. **Safety Request**: Guardian evaluates the request against safety limits
2. **Human Notification**: If approval required, human operator is notified
3. **Approval Interface**: Operator reviews request in `safety_logs/growth_approval.json`
4. **Decision**: Operator approves, denies, or lets request timeout
5. **Execution**: Only approved operations proceed

Example approval file:
```json
{
  "pending_approvals": [
    {
      "request_id": "growth_1234567890",
      "operation_type": "growth",
      "operation_params": {
        "factor": 2.0,
        "add_hidden": 512,
        "reason": "plateau_detected"
      },
      "urgency": "normal",
      "status": "pending",
      "approver": null,
      "approved_at": null
    }
  ]
}
```

To approve: Change `"status": "pending"` to `"status": "approved"` and add your name to `"approver"`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Safety Levels

#### Production (Most Restrictive)
```python
from arbor.safety import PRODUCTION_SAFETY_CONFIG
limits = SafetyLimits(**PRODUCTION_SAFETY_CONFIG["limits"])
```
- 10B parameter limit
- 1 growth event per hour maximum
- 1.2x growth rate limit
- Email alerts enabled
- Strict resource monitoring

#### Development (Balanced)
```python
from arbor.safety import DEVELOPMENT_SAFETY_CONFIG
limits = SafetyLimits(**DEVELOPMENT_SAFETY_CONFIG["limits"])
```
- 100B parameter limit
- 10 growth events per hour
- 3.0x growth rate limit
- Human approval optional
- Relaxed monitoring

#### Custom Configuration
```python
limits = SafetyLimits(
    max_parameters=50_000_000_000,
    max_layers=200,
    max_hidden_size=16384,
    max_growth_events_per_hour=5,
    max_parameter_growth_rate=2.0,
    max_total_growth_factor=10.0,
    max_memory_usage_gb=64.0,
    max_training_time_hours=168,
    require_human_approval_for_growth=True,
    enable_behavior_monitoring=True,
    enable_escape_detection=True,
    emergency_shutdown_threshold=0.95
)
```

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### Emergency Shutdown
Triggered automatically when:
- Resource usage exceeds 95% of limits
- Multiple security alerts in short time
- Model behavior diverges significantly
- Training time exceeds maximum duration

### Emergency Override
For critical situations requiring immediate action:

```python
from arbor.safety import HumanApprovalInterface

approval = HumanApprovalInterface()
override_token = approval.emergency_override(
    operation_type="growth",
    justification="Critical production deadline - plateau detected",
    approver="Senior Engineer #123"
)

# Use token to bypass normal approval (expires in 1 hour)
```

### Manual Safety Controls
```python
# Get safety status
guardian = get_safety_guardian()
report = guardian.get_safety_report()

# Force emergency shutdown
guardian._trigger_emergency_shutdown("Manual shutdown requested")

# Check model integrity
integrity_ok = guardian.verify_model_integrity(model)
```

## üìä Monitoring & Alerts

### Safety Dashboard
Monitor safety status in real-time:
- Current resource usage
- Growth event history
- Security alert timeline
- Model integrity status
- Human approval queue

### Alert Types
1. **Resource Alerts**: High memory/CPU usage
2. **Growth Alerts**: Unusual growth patterns
3. **Security Alerts**: Suspicious behavior detected
4. **Integrity Alerts**: Model state changes
5. **Emergency Alerts**: Critical system violations

### Log Files
All safety events are logged in `safety_logs/`:
- `safety_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log` - General safety events
- `growth_approval.json` - Human approval requests
- `emergency_shutdown.json` - Emergency event details

## üîí Security Features

### Escape Detection
Monitors for attempts to:
- Access unauthorized file systems
- Create network connections
- Modify system files
- Execute external commands
- Manipulate training process

### Model Integrity
- Cryptographic checksums of model weights
- Detection of unauthorized modifications
- Validation of architectural changes
- Audit trail of all model states

### Resource Protection

- CPU usage throttling
- Network access restrictions
- File system access controls

## üß™ Testing & Validation

### Run Safety Demo
```bash
cd arbor-o1-living-ai
python demo_safety.py
```

### Test Individual Components
```python
# Test safety limits
from arbor.safety import SafetyLimits, SafetyViolation

limits = SafetyLimits(max_parameters=1_000_000)
guardian = ArborSafetyGuardian(limits)

# This should raise SafetyViolation
try:
    guardian.validate_growth_request(large_model, "parameters", {"factor": 10.0})
except SafetyViolation as e:
    print(f"Safety system working: {e}")
```

### Integration Testing
```python
# Test with growth manager
growth_manager = GrowthManager(model, optimizer, config)
result = growth_manager.grow_model("test_reason")  # Should be safety-checked
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Safety system not engaging:**
- Check if `initialize_safety_system()` was called
- Verify model is connecting to guardian
- Check safety limits configuration

**Human approval not working:**
- Verify `safety_logs/` directory exists
- Check JSON file formatting
- Ensure approval request hasn't expired

**Emergency shutdown triggering:**
- Review safety logs for trigger cause
- Check resource usage patterns
- Adjust safety limits if appropriate
- Investigate potential security issues

**False positive alerts:**
- Review alert thresholds in configuration
- Check for normal training variations
- Adjust monitoring sensitivity
- Consider whitelist patterns

### Getting Help

1. Check safety logs in `safety_logs/`
